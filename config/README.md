# Customize the config files

## administrators.json
This file contains the list of administrators of the bot. You can add or remove administrators by adding or removing the telegram username in the list. Administrators can manage the whitelist of mentors.

## profile.json
This file contains the list of questions to ask to the users when they fill their profile. You can add or remove questions by adding or removing the question in the list. The questions are asked in the order they are in the list.

The object contain 3 main fields:
```json	
{
  "fields": [],
  "mentorFields": [],
  "menteeFields": []
}
```
First, the bot will ask common questions to both mentors and mentees. Then, it will ask specific questions to mentors and mentees. The questions are asked in the order they are in the list.

To add a question, add a new object in the list with the following fields:
```json	
{
  "name": "the_field_name",
  "label": "ðŸ“™ A more stylish name",
  "type": "string",
  "required": true,
  "id": 45
}
```

The name will be used to identify the question in a more human-readable way.

The label will be displayed on the user profile.

The id must be unique and is used to identify the question in the database.

Type can be "string", "number", "boolean", "stringArray".

You can update name, label, type, and required fields without breaking the database, but you should only change the id if you know what you are doing.

Some optional fields can be added:
```json	
{
  "question": "What is your favorite color?",
}
```
By default the question is generated using the label, with "Please enter your " + label. You can override this behavior by adding the question field.

```json	
{
  "expectedAnswer": [
    {
      "value": "mentor",
      "as": true
    },
    {
      "value": "mentee",
      "label": false
    }
  ],
}
```
The expectedAnswer field is used to validate the user input. If the user input is not in the list, the bot will ask the question again. The value field is the expected value (for instance, this is what is going to be shown on buttons). The as field is what is actually going to be stored in the database.

```json	
{
  "matchingField": "field_name",
}

```json	
{
  "matchingField": "field_name",
}

```json	
{
  "matchingField": "field_name",
}
```
This option has to be set in mentorFields. The bot will find the corresponding provided field in menteeFields to match mentors and mentees. It currently only support stringArray or topics type. The algorithm will match mentors and mentees who have more common values.

```json	
{
  "regex": "^[a-zA-Z0-9]{5,30}$",
}
```
The regex field is used to validate the user input. If the user input does not match the regex, the bot will ask the question again.

```json	
{
  "isUserTypeField": true,
}
```
This should be set only in one field. It must be a common field. The bot will use this field to determine if the user is a mentor or a mentee. The value of this field must be "mentor" or "mentee". The bot will ask the specific questions to the user based on this field.
